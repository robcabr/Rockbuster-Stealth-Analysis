# SQL---Rockbuster-Stealth-Analysis
As a (hypotethical) data analyst for Rockbuster Stealthâ€™s business intelligence (BI) department, I analyzed their data to help to launch strategy for their new online video service, through SQL queries to analyze their data sets and answer any ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.
