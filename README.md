# Rockbuster - Video Rental Analysis
** Context and Objective:** Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores present worldwide. Due to the intense competition from streaming services such as Netlifx and Amazon Prime, the management team is planning to leverage their exisiting movie licenses to release an online video rental service. This project aims to address critical questions from the management board to help shape the company's strategy for the release of their new online platform.

* Creating effective data visualizations

## Project Goals (Critical Questions)
