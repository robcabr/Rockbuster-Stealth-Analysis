# Rockbuster - Video Rental Analysis
**Context and Objective:** Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores present worldwide. Due to the intense competition from streaming services such as Netlifx and Amazon Prime, the management team is planning to leverage their exisiting movie licenses to release an online video rental service. This project aims to address critical questions from the management board to help shape the company's strategy for the release of their new online platform. 

## Techniques Applied
For this project I employed PostGreSQL, Tableau, Excel and Powerpoint as my main tools. Throughout the project, a variety of skills and techniques were applied, including:
* Designing Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)
* Querying databases
* Cleaning and Summarizing data
* Joining tables for comprehensive insights
* Subqueries
* Implementing Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
* Use of Window Functions 
* Creating effective data visualizations

## Project Goals (Critical Questions)
* Identify movies that contributed the most and least revenue gain.
* Analyze the demographics of Rockbuster's customer base.
* Identify and determine high-value customers.
* Analyze if sales figures vary between geographic regions.
* Assess company's overview. 
  
## Data Source
This analysis utilizes a data set that includes comprehensive information about Rockbuster's film inventory, customer, payments transactions from February 2007 to May 2007.

</p>

Based on the dashboard above, we can conclude that 
* Total revenue for the period from February 2007 to May 2007 was of $ 61,312.
* Rockbuster has a total of 958 titles in their inventory.
* The total of customers registered in Rockbuster's system is of 599.

## Addressing Critical Questions

**1. Identify movies that contributed the most and least revenue gain.**

According to the image below, we can see that the movies that contributed the most had a revenue of 168 and above, with Telegraph Voyage as the most lucrative title of all, with a revene of $ 215.75.

</p>

As for the least profitable, as can be seen below four movies, Duffel Apocalypse, Oklahoma Jumanji, Texas Watch and Freedom Cleopatra had the same revenue $ 5.94, making them the least profitable of all.

</p>

Besides the titles, it is possible to assess the genrer for each movie, to see which one is more profitable of all:

  <img width="70%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/robcabr/SQL---Rockbuster-Stealth-Analysis/blob/main/Dashboard/Revenue%20by%20Category.png">
</p>

As can be seen, the top 5 categories - Sports, Sci-fi, Animation, Drama and Comedy had a total revenue of above $ 4,000, totalizing $ 21.594,45, which represents 35% of the total revenue for 2007. 

Despite this, after closely observing the graph above, it is possible to notice that the revenue generated by each genre, below the top 5, are around the same amount, except for the Thriller category, which was able to made only $ 47.89. 

**2. Analyze the demographics of Rockbuster's customer base.**

  <img width="70%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/robcabr/SQL---Rockbuster-Stealth-Analysis/blob/main/Dashboard/Demographic%20-%20Clients.png">
</p>

According to the map above, it is possible to notice that the countries with most clients are India (60) and China (53), making them responsible for almost 20% of the whole customer base.

**3. Identify and determine high-value customers.**

<p align = "center">
  <img width="70%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/robcabr/SQL---Rockbuster-Stealth-Analysis/blob/main/Dashboard/High-value%20customers.png">
</p>

The highest value customers spent more than $ 160, with Elenaor Hunt from Runion, which spent $212, as first place, followed by Karl Seal ($ 209) from United States and Marion Snyder ($ 195) from Brazil as third place.

Also, it is important to highlight that half of the high-value customers are located in countries that are not in the top 10 countries by revenue, which are: Runion, Iran, 

**4. Analyze if sales figures vary between geographic regions.**

<p align = "center">
  <img width="70%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/robcabr/SQL---Rockbuster-Stealth-Analysis/blob/main/Dashboard/Top%2010%20Countries%20-%20by%20Revenue.png">
</p>

The visualization above shows that the top 10 countries are responsible for more than 50% of the revenue generated in 2007, with a total of $ 31,836.13.  

Also, it is possible to notice a massive difference between the first place - India - and the second place - Indonesia -, with a difference of almost 5,000.00 between each other, which demonstrate a great difference of revenue generated by geographic region.

 ## Conclusion and Recommendations

 According to the finding above, it is possible to recommend the following: 
 * **Program Development:** Implement a loyalty program based on rental history, offering discounts, early access to new titles, or even exclusive items could enhance customer retention. Another option, would be to implement a program for returning users, in case Rockbuster has a high rate of customers that haven't used their services for long. 
 * **Geographic Sales Marketing Strategies:** Create region-specific promotions to target customers in non-traditional markets. Considering the fact that some high-value customers are based on non-traditional markets, such as Runion and Iran, localized marketing campaigns featuring popular titles from those regions, or even discouts, could increase the presence of Rockbuster in these regions. 
 * **Bundle Offers:** The creation of Bundles between top rented movies alongside a lesser-known title could be an option to incentivize rentals between movies that have potential but are underperformed or genres that are not popular in certain countries or regions.
 * **Revamp Inventory:** Conduction of a through analysis of movies that generated the least revenue, together with information such as genres that are less popular, to not update tehri license and give priority on titles that attract more audiences, such as Sports, Sci-fi, Animation, Drama and Comedy.  
 * **Personalized Communication:** Creating a direct communication between the company and its customers, or potential customers, via social media or e-mail could result in greater engagement and, consequently, an increase in users.
